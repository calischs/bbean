<p>We are a small, certified organic farm located just east of Madison, established in the fall of 2012. During our inaugural season, we will produce a diverse array of vegetables for our CSA members, neighbors, and local restaurants.</p>

<p><b>About the Farmers:</b> Sarah and Dan have seven collective years of farming experience, and have been been living in Madison and working on farms in the area since 2010. We’re looking forward to kicking off our first season’s CSA share and growing through the experience.
</p>

<p>Our mission is to be good stewards of the land, to grow delicious and nutritious food for our friends and neighbors, and to savor the challenges and bounty of farming. Our farm grows produce without using synthetic chemical pesticides and fertilizers, sources organic
seeds, and utilizes conservation practices that maintain and improve the health of the land we farm, as well as the land around us. We embrace the idea that investing in healthy soils through increasing organic matter and nutrients, cover cropping, and crop rotation will result in healthy plants, and clean, nutritious food for our community. Feed the soil, and it’ll feed your crops!</p>
