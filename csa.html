<p><b>What is CSA?</b></p>

<p><a href='img/csa.jpg'><img class="rightWrap" src='img/csa.jpg' width=350px></a><p>

<p>Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) allows farmers and community members to share responsibility for the production and delivery of fresh food. Members pay a fee before the growing season begins, and then they receive a box (about a large grocery bag) of freshly harvested produce every week between June and October. It's beneficial for farmers to receive CSA checks in the winter and spring, because the beginning of the season is when their costs - seeds, equipment, and other necessities - are the highest. And CSA members benefit by getting to put a face on where their food comes from and reconnect with the land, in addition to receiving seasonal, nutritious, delicious, fresh vegetables each week.</p>

<p><b>Share Options and Pricing</b></p>

<p>Our CSA will run for 20 weeks, from June 4th to October 15th. Shares can be picked up on <b>Wednesdays</b> on the east side of Madison (2454 Hoard St., 4:30pm - 6:30pm) or at The Mason Lounge (416 S. Park St, 4:45pm - 6:45pm). </p>

<p><u>Standard Share ($600)</u>: best for 2 enthusiastic vegetable eaters or larger households, 8-12 different vegetables per week</p>
<p><u>Personal/Individual Share ($350)</u>: great for smaller households and folks who garden, 4 - 7 different vegetables per week</p>
<p><u>Every Other Week Share ($350)</u>: standard sized, ends up being about the same amount of produce as the personal share over the course of the season</p>
<p><u>Flower Share ($50)</u>: 7 weeks of farm fresh flower bouquets, starting at the end of July</p>

<p><b>What will be in my share?</b></p>

<p>In the spring, you’ll receive a lot of cooking and salad greens (lettuce, spinach, pac choy, mustard greens, salad mix), as well as herbs, scallions, radishes, broccoli, hakurei turnips, and kohlrabi. In the fall, your share will be heavy with crops like beets, carrots, potatoes, winter squash, beauty heart radishes, leeks, and onions, plus some fall greens like lettuce and kale. In between, you’ll receive a wide variety of fresh vegetables, including but not limited to tomatoes, eggplant, beans, summer squash, sweet peppers, cucumbers, and herbs.<p>

<p><b>How much food will I receive?</b></p>

<p>In general, standard sized shares yield about one grocery bag full of vegetables each week, and individual shares are about half that size. The share will vary in weight depending on the time of the season, with lighter shares in the greens-laden spring and heavier shares in the roots-laden fall. We aim for your share to supply two omnivorous adults or a small family with a week’s worth of vegetables. If you are a household of vegetarians or if you love vegetables as much as we do, you may want to supplement your CSA share with additional produce that we will have available for sale during peak season.</p>
