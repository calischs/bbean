<p><b>What is CSA?</b></p>

<p><a href='http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8589089525_1c8f6ec4fd.jpg'><img class="rightWrap" src='http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8589089525_1c8f6ec4fd.jpg' alt="kitten contact" width=350px></a></p>

<p>Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) allows farmers and community members to share responsibility for the production and delivery of fresh food. Members pay a fee before the growing season begins, and then they receive a box (about a large grocery bag) of freshly harvested produce every week between June and October. It's beneficial for farmers to receive CSA checks in the winter and spring, because the beginning of the season is when their costs - seeds, equipment, and other necessities - are the highest. And CSA members benefit by getting to put a face on where their food comes from and reconnect with the land, in addition to receiving seasonal, nutritious, delicious, fresh vegetables each week.</p>

<p><b>About Our CSA</b></p>

<p>Our CSA will run for 20 weeks, from June 5th to October 16th. We will host a market-style CSA pick-up in our backyard on the east side of Madison at 2454 Hoard St. on Wednesdays from 4:30pm - 7pm. This will allow you as a member to make some choices about what specific items go into your share each week (i.e. you will often get to choose among three different kinds of herbs, or choose one big butternut squash versus two smaller pumpkins). Another advantage of market-style pick up is that you get to hand select which bunch of radishes looks best to you! And, starting in July, members will be able to cut flowers from our u-pick flower garden to take home. </p>

<p><b>What will be in my share?</b></p>

<p>In the spring, you’ll receive a lot of cooking and salad greens (lettuce, spinach, bok choi, mustard greens, salad mix), as well as herbs, scallions, radishes, broccoli, hakuri turnips, and kohlrabi. In the fall, your share will be heavy with crops like beets, carrots, potatoes, winter squash, beauty heart radishes, leeks, and onions, plus some fall greens like lettuce and kale. In between, you’ll receive a wide variety of fresh vegetables, including but not limited to tomatoes, eggplant, beans, summer squash, sweet peppers, cucumbers, and herbs. Each week, there will be 6 to 12 items in your share depending on the time of the season.<p>

<p><b>How much food will I receive?</b></p>

<p>In general, you’ll receive about one grocery bag full of vegetables each week. The share will vary in weight depending on the time of the season, with lighter shares in the greens-laden spring and heavier shares in the roots-laden fall. We aim for your share to supply two omnivorous adults or a small family with a week’s worth of vegetables. If you are a household of vegetarians or if you love vegetables as much as we do, you may want to supplement your CSA share with additional produce that we will have available for sale at our CSA market stand pick-up on Wednesdays.</p>

<p><b>Organic Egg Shares</b></p>

<p>We are partnering with Sun Harvest Farm (located on the same property as our farm!) to offer you the option of receiving fresh, pastured, organic eggs on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Egg shares will be available for pick up on Wednesday evenings during our vegetable CSA pick up. The weekly egg shares will go for 20 weeks, June 5th to October 16th, and cost $120. Bi-weekly egg shares will be picked up every other week for a total of 10 pick ups, and cost $60.<p>
